# Deployment Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Express Version Compatibility Issue
**Problem**: The application was using Express 5.1.0 which has compatibility issues with path-to-regexp, causing the server to crash on startup with:
```
TypeError: Missing parameter name at 1: https://git.new/pathToRegexpError
```

**Solution**: Downgraded Express to version 4.19.2 in `backend/package.json`
- Updated from `"express": "^5.1.0"` to `"express": "^4.19.2"`
- Removed package-lock.json and reinstalled dependencies

### 2. Import Typo in Debounce Service
**Problem**: The debounce service file was named `debouce.ts` (missing 'n') and imported incorrectly in PlateEditor.tsx

**Solution**: 
- Renamed file from `frontend/src/services/debouce.ts` to `frontend/src/services/debounce.ts`
- Fixed import statement in PlateEditor.tsx from `@/services/debouce` to `@/services/debounce`

### 3. Environment Configuration for Production
**Problem**: API URL configuration was not properly set for production deployment

**Solution**: 
- Created `frontend/.env` with `VITE_API_URL=` (empty for relative paths in production)
- Ensured API calls use relative paths when served by the same backend server

### 4. Build and Deployment Process
**Problem**: While the build was successful, the runtime errors prevented the app from loading

**Solution**: 
- Fixed all runtime issues mentioned above
- Verified build process works correctly
- Ensured static files are served properly by Express backend

## Current Status

âœ… **Application is fully functional**
- Server running on port 3001
- Frontend correctly built and served by backend
- API endpoints responding correctly
- MongoDB connection working
- All assets loading properly

## Application Features Working

1. **Rich Text Editor**: Plate.js-based editor with formatting tools
2. **AI Fact-Checking**: Select text and click "Ask AI" for fact verification
3. **Real-time Saving**: Content automatically saves to MongoDB
4. **Comments System**: Sidebar with fact-check results and comments
5. **Modern UI**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components

## Access

The application is now accessible at: **http://localhost:3001**

## Deployment Verification

To verify the deployment is working:

1. **Check server status**:
   ```bash
   curl -I http://localhost:3001
   ```

2. **Test API endpoints**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3001/api/pages/6880685272487d5a361368e9
   ```

3. **Verify static assets**:
   ```bash
   curl -I http://localhost:3001/assets/index-CwFIq5QD.js
   curl -I http://localhost:3001/assets/index-CmeZ_KPN.css
   ```

All tests should return HTTP 200 OK responses.

## Next Steps

The application is ready for production use. For actual deployment:

1. Set proper environment variables (MONGODB_URI, etc.)
2. Configure production domain in CORS settings if needed
3. Set up SSL/HTTPS if required
4. Configure proper MongoDB production database

## Build Commands

For future deployments, use:

```bash
# Full build (as configured in package.json)
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```
